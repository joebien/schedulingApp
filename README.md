A simple event calendar app built on React and Express

This is a RESTful app using express and configured to deploy on Firebase using FireBase Cloud Functions. It will run locally as an express base api.

Clone https://github.com/joebien/schedulingApp.git

Run `npm install` from the root directory

Run `node functions/index.js` from the root directory to load express api

Then run 'npm start' to load react based interface

Comments welcome.
